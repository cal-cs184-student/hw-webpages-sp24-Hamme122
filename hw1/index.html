    <h1>Project1</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>In this project, we developed a basic rasterization engine capable of rendering lines, triangles, and shapes from SVG files, adding color and texture. We explored various sampling techniques for texture filtering and mipmap level adjustment.</p>

    <p>The experience enhanced our understanding of applying theoretical formulas to practical image generation and rendering, translating class-learned concepts into visual outcomes based on coordinates and directives.</p>

    <h2>Task 1</h2>

    <p>To rasterize triangles, we will first create a bounding box for the triangle. This is achieved by calculating the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates among the vertices and rounding them to integer values to establish the boundaries of the loop.</p>

    <p>Then, for each integer coordinate within this bounding box, we check whether each pixel lies inside the triangle by using the three-line test. Essentially, this works by treating each line as the boundary of a half-plane, where the half-plane includes the area within the triangle. If a point is inside all three half-planes, then it must be inside of the triangle.</p>

    <p>If a pixel is determined to be inside the triangle, the <code>fill_pixel</code> function is called to color it with the specified color. This process repeats for every pixel within the bounding box, effectively rasterizing the triangle.</p>

    <p>Overall, the algorithm's integer grid-based approach, coupled with geometric principles, minimizes unnecessary computations, ensuring that it performs <strong>no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box</strong>. In fact, it likely outperforms such a brute-force approach in terms of both computational efficiency and accuracy in rasterizing the triangle.</p>

    <p>The image below illustrates how triangles in <em>test4.svg</em> are rendered:</p>
