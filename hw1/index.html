    <h1>Project 1</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      In this project, we developed a basic rasterization engine capable of rendering lines, triangles, and shapes from SVG files, adding color and texture. We explored various sampling techniques for texture filtering and mipmap level adjustment. The experience enhanced our understanding of applying theoretical formulas to practical image generation and rendering, translating class-learned concepts into visual outcomes based on coordinates and directives.

    <h2>Task 1</h2>
    <p>
      To rasterize triangles, we will first create a bounding box for the triangle. This is achieved by calculating the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates among the vertices and rounding them to integer values to establish the boundaries of the loop. Then, for each integer coordinate within this bounding box, we check whether each pixel lies inside the triangle by using the three-line test. Essentially, this works by treating each line as the boundary of a half-plane, where the half-plane includes the area within the triangle. If a point is inside all three half-planes, then it must be inside of the triangle. If a pixel is determined to be inside the triangle, the <code>fill_pixel</code> function is called to color it with the specified color. This process repeats for every pixel within the bounding box, effectively rasterizing the triangle. Overall, the algorithm's integer grid-based approach, coupled with geometric principles, minimizes unnecessary computations, ensuring that it performs no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box. In fact, it likely outperforms such a brute-force approach in terms of both computational efficiency and accuracy in rasterizing the triangle.
